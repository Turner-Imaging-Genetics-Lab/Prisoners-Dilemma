# Prisoner's-Dilemma Algorithms
The code located in this repository was written by ***Khalil I. Thompson, M.A.***, a Ph.D. candidate working with Dr. Jessica Turner and Dr. Erin Tone in the ***Department of Psychology at Georgia State University (Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience concentration***. The code is Python-based and was developed for the purpose of constructing Prisoner's Dilemma algorithms that could be utilized to study social decision-making and behavioral patterns in socially anxious populations. This population exhibits a host of sociocognitive biases and maladaptive behaviors that are effectively captured with the Prisoner's Dilemma and other economic-exchange tasks. The code used for my dissertation was eventually integrated into a ***PsychoPy*** (stimulus presentation software) experiment, and this experiment can now be played online through the behavioral psychology experiment repositiory ***Pavlovia*** (pavlovia.org). ***If you have any additional questions about this code please email me at kthompson70@gsu.edu or khalilt93@gmail.com***.
