# Prisoners-Dilemma
The code in this repository was written by Khalil Thompson, MA, a Ph.D. candidate working with Dr. Jessica Turner and Dr. Erin Tone in the Department of Psychology at Georgia State University. The code is Python-based and developed for the purpose of constructing Prisoner's Dilemma algorithms that could be used to study decision-making in socially anxious populations. This population exhibits a host of maladaptive behaviors that are effectively captured with the Prisoner's Dilemma and other economic-exchange tasks. The code used for my dissertation was eventually integrated into a PsychoPy (stimulus presentation software) experiment, and this experiment can now be played online through the behavioral psychology experiment repositiory Pavlovia (pavlovia.org). If you have any additional questions about this code please email me at kthompson70@gsu.edu or khalilt93@gmail.com.
